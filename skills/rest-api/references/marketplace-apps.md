# Zoom Marketplace API

Authoritative endpoint inventory for Marketplace. This file mirrors the official Zoom API Hub OpenAPI document for this product area.

## Canonical Source

- OpenAPI JSON: https://developers.zoom.us/api-hub/marketplace/methods/endpoints.json
- Base URL: `https://api.zoom.us/v2`
- Authentication details: [authentication.md](authentication.md)

## Notes

- Endpoint methods and paths below are generated from the official Zoom API Hub `paths` object.
- Scope names are defined per operation and frequently use granular scope names. Check the API Hub operation page for the exact scopes before implementation.
- Use this file for endpoint discovery and inventory. Use `../examples/` for orchestration patterns, not as the canonical source of path names.

## Bootstrap Requirement: Create the First App Manually

Marketplace app creation is not self-bootstrapping. The create APIs require a Zoom OAuth
access token, and that token must come from an app that already exists. For a new account or
automation environment:

1. An account owner, admin, or user with the required Zoom developer role manually creates the
   first credential-bearing app in the Zoom App Marketplace.
2. Add the exact Marketplace app-management scope required by the creation endpoint.
3. Activate/install or authorize that bootstrap app as required by its app type.
4. Mint an access token from the bootstrap app.
5. Use that token to validate manifests and create subsequent apps through the Marketplace API.

The bootstrap app can commonly be either:

- a manually created **Server-to-Server OAuth app** for unattended same-account automation; or
- a manually created **admin-managed General App** when an account admin will complete the
  authorization-code flow.

However, app type alone is not sufficient. The token must contain the scope for the exact
endpoint, and the caller must satisfy its role restrictions:

| Creation target | Endpoint | Required scope | Bootstrap guidance |
|-----------------|----------|----------------|--------------------|
| General App manifest | `POST /v2/marketplace/apps` | `marketplace:write:app` or `marketplace:write:app:admin` | An admin-managed General App or an S2S app with the accepted admin scope is suitable for account automation. The documented user scope also permits a user-authorized path where available. |
| S2S OAuth or Meeting SDK app | `POST /v2/accounts/{accountId}/marketplace/apps` | `marketplace:write:app:master` | Requires the account owner/master-authorized path. Use a bootstrap app that can actually mint this master scope; do not assume `marketplace:write:app:admin` is equivalent. |

Practical guardrails:

- You cannot use the credentials of the app being created to authorize its own creation.
- Confirm the returned token's granted `scope` before calling the API.
- A scope appearing in an API description does not prove it is enabled for every account or
  selectable on every app type; verify it in the bootstrap app's Marketplace scope picker.
- Keep at least one working bootstrap app until a replacement app has successfully minted a
  token and created a disposable test app.
- Restrict the bootstrap app to Marketplace administration, store its secret/refresh token in a
  secret manager, and do not reuse it as a general application credential.

## Auth Caveat: App-Owned Marketplace Scopes

Some Marketplace app-management scopes require an app-owned access token from the OAuth
`client_credentials` grant, not a user OAuth token and not a Server-to-Server
`account_credentials` token.

Use this flow when the Marketplace operation calls for scopes such as:

| Scope | Typical use |
|-------|-------------|
| `marketplace:write:event_subscription` | Create app event subscriptions |
| `marketplace:read:list_event_subscriptions` | List app event subscriptions |
| `marketplace:update:event_subscription` | Update or subscribe event subscriptions |
| `marketplace:delete:event_subscription` | Delete or unsubscribe event subscriptions |
| `marketplace:write:websocket_connection` | Create app-owned WebSocket connections |

Token request:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://zoom.us/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $(printf '%s:%s' "$ZOOM_CLIENT_ID" "$ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET" | base64)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
```

Implementation rule:
- Use `client_credentials` for app-owned Marketplace scopes listed above.
- Use `account_credentials` only for Server-to-Server OAuth account automation scopes.
- Use `authorization_code` only when the API should act on behalf of an installing user.

## App Creation, Manifest, and Response Shapes

Use these notes when creating General Apps through the Marketplace API. They are based on
live API behavior observed on 2026-07-08 and should be treated as more precise than the
high-level endpoint inventory.

### General App Manifest Modes

For General App OAuth manifests, `oauth_information.usage` currently accepts only:

| Usage value | Meaning | Scope shape |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `USER_OPERATION` | User-level General App | User scopes such as `user:read:user` |
| `ADMIN_MANAGEMENT` | Admin/account-level General App | Admin scopes such as `user:read:user:admin` |

Invalid examples:
- `ACCOUNT_OPERATION` is rejected.
- A `USER_OPERATION` manifest with an admin scope is rejected.
- An `ADMIN_MANAGEMENT` manifest with a user scope is rejected.
- App-owned Marketplace scopes such as `marketplace:write:event_subscription` are rejected in `oauth_information.scopes`; those belong to `client_credentials` token usage, not the authorization-code OAuth manifest scope list.
- If scopes are present, at least one scope must be non-optional.
- Invalid scope names return `ok: false` from manifest validation.
- User-level scopes can be granular names such as `user:read:email`.
- Admin/account-level scopes can be granular names such as `meeting:read:meeting:admin`.

Minimal user-level manifest:

```json
{
  "display_information": {
    "display_name": "My User General App"
  },
  "oauth_information": {
    "usage": "USER_OPERATION",
    "development_redirect_uri": "https://example.com/oauth/callback",
    "production_redirect_uri": "https://example.com/oauth/callback",
    "oauth_allow_list": ["https://example.com/oauth/callback"],
    "scopes": [
      { "scope": "user:read:user", "optional": false }
    ],
    "strict_mode": false,
    "subdomain_strict_mode": false
  },
  "developer_information": {
    "developer_name": "Example Developer",
    "developer_email": "developer@example.com",
    "company_name": "Example Co",
    "website": "https://example.com",
    "privacy_policy": "https://example.com/privacy",
    "terms_of_use": "https://example.com/terms",
    "support": "https://example.com/support"
  },
  "features": {
    "products": []
  }
}
```

Minimal admin/account-level manifest:

```json
{
  "display_information": {
    "display_name": "My Admin General App"
  },
  "oauth_information": {
    "usage": "ADMIN_MANAGEMENT",
    "development_redirect_uri": "https://example.com/oauth/callback",
    "production_redirect_uri": "https://example.com/oauth/callback",
    "oauth_allow_list": ["https://example.com/oauth/callback"],
    "scopes": [
      { "scope": "user:read:user:admin", "optional": false }
    ],
    "strict_mode": false,
    "subdomain_strict_mode": false
  },
  "developer_information": {
    "developer_name": "Example Developer",
    "developer_email": "developer@example.com",
    "company_name": "Example Co",
    "website": "https://example.com",
    "privacy_policy": "https://example.com/privacy",
    "terms_of_use": "https://example.com/terms",
    "support": "https://example.com/support"
  },
  "features": {
    "products": []
  }
}
```

### Manifest Validation Response Shape

`POST /marketplace/apps/manifest/validate` returns HTTP `200` for both valid and invalid manifests.
Always inspect `ok`.

Valid response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "error": "",
  "errors": null
}
```

Invalid response:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "invalid_manifest",
  "errors": [
    {
      "setting": "/oauth_information/scopes[0]",
      "message": "user:read:user:admin is not a valid scope name when usage is USER_OPERATION"
    }
  ]
}
```

Common validation quirks:
- Empty `oauth_information.scopes: []` can validate, but an installable production app usually needs scopes aligned to the intended API calls.
- Missing `oauth_information.scopes` can also validate and can create an app with `app_scopes: []`; do not use this for apps that need API access.
- If `oauth_information.scopes` is non-empty, include at least one `{ "optional": false }` scope.
- A scope entry missing the `optional` field, using `"optional": "false"` as a string, or duplicating the same scope can validate. Do not rely on that permissiveness; emit boolean `optional` values and dedupe scopes yourself.
- Classic scope names such as `user:read` can be rejected for current General App manifests; prefer granular names such as `user:read:email`.
- Chatbot scope `imchat:bot` validated under `ADMIN_MANAGEMENT` with `products: ["ZOOM_CHAT"]`, but was rejected under `USER_OPERATION` in live tests.
- If `features.products` is empty, do not set `features.development_home_uri` or `features.domain_allow_list`.
- `features.domain_allow_list` does not accept plain strings. When a selected product requires domains, use object entries such as `{ "domain": "example.com" }`.
- `display_information.display_name` is required and must be less than 50 characters.
- If `features.team_chat_subscription.enable` is `true`, include `features.team_chat_subscription.slash_command.development_message_url`. Missing or blank development message URL fails validation even when `production_message_url` is present. `production_message_url` can be omitted or blank for development-only chatbot manifests.
- Team Chat shortcut objects use `action_types` as an array. Do not use singular `action_type`; invalid `action_types` enum values are rejected.
- Event subscription manifests should use `WEB_SOCKET` when selecting a WebSocket subscription type. Do not invent lowercase or alternate enum spellings.
- `features.sdk_domain_allow_list` can be schema-valid but account/feature gated. A live validation run reported `ok: false` with a message equivalent to `SDK domain allowlist feature is not enabled for this account`.
- The validation endpoint is not a complete production-readiness check. It accepted invalid-looking development redirect URLs, missing redirect fields, missing developer information, missing `features`, and unknown top-level keys in live tests on 2026-07-08.
- Manifest validation can pass feature sections independently; publish/review may still require additional Basic Information, privacy, support, domain, scope justification, event, and product-specific configuration that validation does not enforce.
- Existing saved manifests are not guaranteed to round-trip through current validation. In live app exports, saved RTMS meeting/webinar event subscriptions and duplicate slash command names could export successfully but fail `POST /manifest/validate` when submitted again.

### Broad Manifest Schema Coverage

Official manifest schema pages currently document these top-level General App sections:

| Section | Officially documented fields or values | Validation guidance |
|---------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `display_information` | `display_name`, `description`, `long_description`, `company_name`, `discover_type`, `install_type`, `marketplace_categories`, `industry_vertical`, `market_segments`, `business_lines`, `privacy_url`, `terms_url`, `support_url`, `doc_url`, `config_url` | Use documented enum values such as `UNLISTED` / `LISTED` and `APP_DIRECTORY` / `LANDING_PAGE`; invalid enum values were rejected in validation probes |
| `oauth_information` | `usage`, redirect URIs, allow-list, strict modes, `scopes`, `scope_description`, `enable_private_pkce_client`, `enable_public_pkce_client`, public key settings | Use `USER_OPERATION` or `ADMIN_MANAGEMENT`; lowercase variants were rejected |
| `oauth_information.*_public_key` | `enabled`, `well_known_url`, `keys[]` JWK fields for RSA or EC keys | `well_known_url` is mutually exclusive with inline `keys`; inline RSA and EC JWK shapes are documented by Zoom and were accepted in a parallel validation run |
| `features.products` | `ZOOM_MEETING`, `ZOOM_CHAT`, `ZOOM_PHONE`, `ZOOM_ROOM`, `ZOOM_WEBINAR`, `ZOOM_CONTACT_CENTER`, `ZOOM_WHITEBOARD`, `ZOOM_EVENTS` | Invalid product enum values were rejected |
| `features` | `connector`, `in_client_feature`, `zoom_client_support`, `embed`, `team_chat_subscription`, `event_subscription`, `connect`, `customer_form`, `marketplace_actions`, `sdk_domain_allow_list`, `plugin_sdk` | Prefer the official key `customer_form`. A parallel validation run also saw `custom_form` accepted, but do not emit it in new manifests |
| Template feature sections | `in_client_feature`, `zoom_client_support`, `embed`, `team_chat_subscription`, `event_subscription` | These can validate independently; Marketplace review can still require product-specific evidence and complete production URLs |
| Schema-only feature sections | `connector`, `connect`, `customer_form`, `marketplace_actions`, `marketplace_triggers`, `plugin_sdk` | Parallel validation reported these accepted with `enable: true`, but treat them as schema coverage only unless the app actually uses the feature |

Broad combined manifests are useful for schema testing but are not yet proven as one-shot
create/persist inputs. A parallel live run reported that a broad combined manifest validated
across many sections, but `POST /marketplace/apps` returned `401 Access Denied` for the
full combined create attempt. When using broad manifests, validate first, then create/update
with the smallest feature set required by the app, and confirm persistence with
`GET /marketplace/apps/{appId}/manifest`.

### General App Create/Get/Manifest/Update/Delete Shapes

Create General App:

```http
POST /v2/marketplace/apps
```

Request:

```json
{
  "app_type": "general",
  "app_name": "My General App",
  "contact_name": "Example Developer",
  "contact_email": "developer@example.com",
  "company_name": "Example Co",
  "manifest": {
    "...": "valid manifest"
  }
}
```

Observed minimal create response:

```json
{
  "app_id": "n4C4AvnpSm6Jg9JSV0bgww"
}
```

Possible create response with credentials:

```json
{
  "app_id": "n4C4AvnpSm6Jg9JSV0bgww",
  "app_name": "My General App",
  "app_type": "general",
  "development_credentials": {
    "client_id": "CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "CLIENT_SECRET"
  }
}
```

Observed create response with a `credentials` wrapper:

```json
{
  "app_id": "n4C4AvnpSm6Jg9JSV0bgww",
  "oauth_authorize_url": "https://zoom.us/oauth/authorize?...",
  "credentials": {
    "client_id": "CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "CLIENT_SECRET"
  }
}
```

Do not rely on documented `201` or a single fixed response shape for General App creates.
Live behavior can return HTTP `200`; it may return only `app_id` or may include generated
General App credentials. If credentials are returned, those Client ID/Secret values can be
used to mint `client_credentials` tokens for app-owned scopes when the app has the required
app-owned scopes. If the response only returns `app_id`, retrieve credentials from the
Marketplace app credentials surface or a documented credential endpoint before testing
app-owned token flows. Credential fields have appeared as `credentials` and
`development_credentials`; treat both as possible shapes and never log the secret values.

Get created app:

```http
GET /v2/marketplace/apps/{appId}
```

Observed user-level response shape:

```json
{
  "app_name": "My General App",
  "app_type": "OAuthApp",
  "app_status": "unpublished",
  "app_scopes": ["user:read:user"]
}
```

Observed admin/account-level response shape:

```json
{
  "app_name": "My Admin General App",
  "app_type": "OAuthApp",
  "app_status": "unpublished",
  "app_scopes": ["user:read:user:admin"]
}
```

Export manifest:

```http
GET /v2/marketplace/apps/{appId}/manifest
```

For the complete export, validate, full-replacement update, and read-back sequence, use
[Marketplace Manifest Update Workflow](marketplace-manifest-update-workflow.md). For automated
scenario selection, use the machine-readable
[Marketplace template index](../assets/marketplace-apps/marketplace-manifest-template-index.json).

Response shape:

```json
{
  "manifest": {
    "...": "inner manifest"
  }
}
```

### Manifest Export Caveats

Export caveats observed from existing apps:
- Draft General apps with granular scopes exported cleanly in live read-only checks.
- Published apps and some legacy/non-General/S2S-style apps can return HTTP `404` with Zoom `code: 1500`, for example `You can only export Draft General app's manifest now`.
- Server-to-Server OAuth/private OAuth-style apps do not export through this endpoint as General App manifests; expect `You can only export Draft General app's manifest now`.
- Older or non-granular General apps may return `You can only export manifest with app support granular scope now`; treat this as an exportability limitation, not proof the app is misconfigured.
- `GET /manifest` can export a saved manifest that fails current `POST /manifest/validate`; always validate before using an exported manifest as an update template.
- A saved Team Chat chatbot slash command can fail validation on export/re-submit if the command name is already in use in the account. Rename slash commands when cloning manifests.

Update manifest:

```http
PUT /v2/marketplace/apps/{appId}/manifest
```

Request shape:

```json
{
  "manifest": {
    "...": "inner manifest only"
  }
}
```

Do not pass the full export response as the `manifest` value. This is wrong:

```json
{
  "manifest": {
    "manifest": {
      "...": "nested wrapper"
    }
  }
}
```

Passing the export wrapper instead of the inner manifest can produce misleading validation errors.
Successful `PUT /manifest` can return HTTP `200` with an empty body.

Delete created app:

```http
DELETE /v2/marketplace/apps/{appId}
```

Observed delete response is HTTP `200` with an empty body. Do not require the documented
`204` to treat deletion as successful.

### Permissive Manifest Cases Observed in Create Tests

Live create/delete tests on 2026-07-08 confirmed that some manifests accepted by
`/manifest/validate` are also accepted by `POST /marketplace/apps`. Treat these as
Marketplace leniency, not recommended manifest style:

| Case | Create result | Export/get behavior |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| Empty `oauth_information.scopes: []` | HTTP `200` | `GET /apps/{appId}` returned `app_scopes: []`; exported manifest omitted/nullified scopes |
| Missing `oauth_information.scopes` | HTTP `200` | `app_scopes: []`; exported manifest omitted/nullified scopes |
| `oauth_allow_list` that does not include redirect URI | HTTP `200` | Export preserved mismatched allow-list |
| Missing `development_redirect_uri` | HTTP `200` | Exported `development_redirect_uri: ""` |
| Invalid-looking `development_redirect_uri: "not-a-url"` | HTTP `200` | Export preserved the invalid-looking string |
| Missing `developer_information` | HTTP `200` | Export only included `display_information`, `oauth_information`, and `features` |
| Missing `features` | HTTP `200` | Export reintroduced `features` |
| Unknown top-level key | HTTP `200` | Export dropped the unknown key |

Practical rule: generate strict manifests even if the API accepts loose ones. Include scopes,
valid HTTPS redirect URIs, a matching allow-list, developer information, and `features.products`
explicitly. Use validation as a syntax/scope-mode check, then fetch the manifest after create or
update to confirm what Zoom actually persisted.

### Existing App Manifest Archetypes Observed

Read-only exports of existing apps on 2026-07-08 surfaced these useful shape patterns:

| Archetype | Manifest shape | Route to |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Meeting SDK / meeting-surface app | Usually `products: ["ZOOM_MEETING"]`, Meeting-related scopes, optional embed/in-client feature sections, event subscriptions only when the app also listens for meeting events | [Meeting SDK](../../meeting-sdk/SKILL.md) or [Meeting SDK Web](../../meeting-sdk/web/SKILL.md) |
| RTMS meeting/webinar app | `products: ["ZOOM_MEETING"]`, `event_subscription.enable: true`, RTMS event names may appear in saved exports but fail current manifest validation | [RTMS](../../rtms/SKILL.md) and [RTMS webhooks](../../rtms/references/webhooks.md) |
| ZCC/Phone surface app | `products` can include combinations such as `["ZOOM_CONTACT_CENTER", "ZOOM_PHONE"]`; may have zero OAuth scopes when the app is surface/configuration focused | [Contact Center](../../contact-center/SKILL.md) and [Phone](../../phone/SKILL.md) |
| Team Chat user API app | `usage: "USER_OPERATION"`, `products: ["ZOOM_CHAT"]`, Team Chat user scopes such as `team_chat:*`, optional `imchat:userapp`, `team_chat_subscription.enable: false` | [Team Chat](../../team-chat/SKILL.md) |
| Admin OAuth / account-scoped API app | `usage: "ADMIN_MANAGEMENT"`, admin granular scopes, often `products: []` or a product-specific surface, admin install required | [OAuth](../../oauth/SKILL.md) and [app types](../../general/references/app-types.md) |
| Chatbot app | `usage: "ADMIN_MANAGEMENT"`, `products: ["ZOOM_CHAT"]`, scope `imchat:bot`, `team_chat_subscription.enable: true`, slash command development message URL present, production message URL may be blank | [Team Chat chatbot](../../team-chat/SKILL.md) |
| Webhook-heavy app | `event_subscription.enable: true` can appear even when `products: []`; event entries use `event_usage` such as `EVENT_FOR_USER` or `EVENT_FOR_ADMIN`; large event lists may not round-trip through validation unchanged | [Webhooks](../../webhooks/SKILL.md) and this Marketplace reference |
| WebSocket event app | Account-level only; use S2S or admin-managed General App, then select WebSocket delivery in Features > Access because the public manifest schema does not expose a reliable one-shot field | [WebSockets](../../websockets/SKILL.md) |
| Plugin SDK companion | `usage: "USER_OPERATION"`, scope `plugin_sdk:read:connection_meta`, PKCE for native clients, and `plugin_sdk.enable: true`; the OAuth user must match the user signed in to Zoom Workplace | [OAuth](../../oauth/SKILL.md) plus the official Plugin SDK documentation |
| MCP API app | `usage: "USER_OPERATION"`, `products: []` or omitted, no Team Chat subscription, and scopes selected for the exact Zoom MCP server tools | [Zoom MCP](../../zoom-mcp/SKILL.md) and [Marketplace template selector](marketplace-app-templates.md) |

Do not infer app behavior from `app_type` alone. Existing apps returned both `OAuthApp` and
`ZoomApp` for General-app-style manifests; inspect `oauth_information.usage`, `products`,
features, scopes, and event subscriptions instead.

Cross-reference this section from:
- [General app types](../../general/references/app-types.md) when choosing General App scope level and surfaces.
- [Marketplace portal guide](../../general/references/marketplace.md) when exporting or cloning manifests.
- [Marketplace publishing use case](../../general/use-cases/marketplace-publishing.md) when preparing review-ready app configurations.

### RTMS Event Subscription Validation Drift

Existing saved RTMS apps exported event subscriptions containing names such as:

```json
[
  "meeting.rtms_started",
  "meeting.rtms_stopped",
  "meeting.rtms_interrupted",
  "webinar.rtms_started",
  "webinar.rtms_stopped",
  "webinar.rtms_interrupted",
  "rtms.concurrency_limited",
  "rtms.concurrency_near_limit"
]
```

However, a live validation probe on 2026-07-08 rejected those meeting/webinar RTMS event names
inside `features.event_subscription.events[].event_types`. The same probe accepted Contact
Center Voice RTMS event names:

```json
[
  "contact_center.voice_rtms_started",
  "contact_center.voice_rtms_stopped",
  "contact_center.voice_rtms_interrupted"
]
```

Follow-up create/update probe:
- `POST /manifest/validate` rejected `meeting.rtms_*` and `rtms.concurrency_*` event names.
- `POST /marketplace/apps` with those event names also returned `400 invalid_manifest`.
- `PUT /marketplace/apps/{appId}/manifest` against an existing draft General App returned
  HTTP `200` and a subsequent `GET /manifest` showed those RTMS event names persisted.

Practical rule: for RTMS meeting/webinar event subscriptions, do not use create-time manifest
validation as the only source of truth. Prefer Marketplace UI or the event-subscription API.
If you must use manifests, create the draft app with a valid baseline manifest, then test
`PUT /manifest` and immediately `GET /manifest` to confirm the RTMS event subscriptions
actually persisted. Do not assume every validation failure can be bypassed this way; most
structural validation failures still blocked both create and update in live tests.

### Event Subscription Pairing

Event subscription APIs are app-owned operations and should use a General App
`client_credentials` token when the subscription scopes require app-owned access.

Observed working user-managed pairing from a parallel validation run:

```json
{
  "subscription_scope": "user",
  "user_ids": ["USER_ID"]
}
```

This worked with a user-managed General App and a `client_credentials` token minted from
that app's Client ID and Client Secret. A direct verification run on 2026-07-08 could not
reproduce the token step because `POST /marketplace/apps` returned only `app_id`, so treat
the subscription pairing as dependent on having access to the generated General App
credentials first.

Observed admin/account-level caveat:
- Creating an account-scoped event subscription for an admin-managed General App before the app is authorized/installed can fail with:

```text
The user don't authorize the app.
```

Treat account-scoped event subscription setup as requiring the General App to be authorized/installed first.

### Webhook-only and S2S Creation Quirks

The public app-creation endpoint accepts only the documented `POST /marketplace/apps` shape, but
live behavior is nuanced:

- `app_type: "general"` with a valid manifest creates a General/OAuth-style app.
- `app_type: "webhook_only"` with the same valid manifest was accepted, but `GET /marketplace/apps/{appId}` reported `app_type: "OAuthApp"` and OAuth scopes. Do not treat this as proof that the API created a true Webhook-only App.
- `app_type: "webhook"` behaved similarly in live probing.

For Server-to-Server OAuth creation, the current Marketplace API description lists
`app_type: "s2s_oauth"` on both create surfaces, but live routing on 2026-07-10 required the
account-scoped endpoint:

- `POST /v2/marketplace/apps` returned HTTP `404`, Zoom code `1500`, directing the caller to
  `/v2/accounts/{accountId}/marketplace/apps` for Meeting SDK or S2S OAuth app creation.
- `POST /v2/accounts/{accountId}/marketplace/apps` requires
  `marketplace:write:app:master` and is account-owner/master-scope sensitive.
- Set `active: true` only when `scopes` contains at least one valid scope. Use
  `active: false` to create an inactive draft.
- Do not send a General App `manifest` for `s2s_oauth`; send top-level `scopes`.
- S2S has a single credential state. The API labels that one pair
  `development_credentials`; `production_credentials` is not expected for S2S. Meeting SDK
  publishing has a separate development/production credential model. Capture S2S credentials
  once and never log or commit client secrets.

A live authorization probe on 2026-07-10 reached the account-scoped endpoint, but the supplied
tokens lacked its required master scope:

```json
{
  "code": 201,
  "message": "Invalid access token, does not contain scopes:[marketplace:write:app:master]."
}
```

That earlier probe did not create an app. A follow-up production probe on **2026-07-13** used a
token containing `marketplace:write:app:master` and confirmed the complete reversible flow:

- `POST /v2/accounts/{accountId}/marketplace/apps` returned HTTP `201`.
- `app_type: "s2s_oauth"` created an inactive S2S OAuth app.
- The requested `meeting:read:meeting:admin` scope was preserved in the response.
- `DELETE /v2/marketplace/apps/{appId}` returned HTTP `200` with an empty body and removed the
  temporary app. The live delete status therefore differs from the documented `204` response.

Use the account-scoped route and a token containing `marketplace:write:app:master`; do not rely
on the broader operation description for the regular create endpoint until runtime behavior
changes. Treat returned client credentials as one-time secrets even when running an inactive
creation probe.

### S2S Create, Token, and Manifest Shapes (Verified 2026-07-13)

S2S OAuth uses a native top-level request, not the General App manifest model.

Minimal inactive request (scopes can be omitted):

```json
{
  "app_type": "s2s_oauth",
  "app_name": "My S2S App",
  "contact_name": "Developer Name",
  "contact_email": "developer@example.com",
  "company_name": "Example Company",
  "active": false
}
```

Active request (at least one valid scope is required):

```json
{
  "app_type": "s2s_oauth",
  "app_name": "My Active S2S App",
  "contact_name": "Developer Name",
  "contact_email": "developer@example.com",
  "company_name": "Example Company",
  "active": true,
  "scopes": [
    "meeting:read:meeting:admin"
  ]
}
```

Do not send `manifest` or `publish` for S2S. The live endpoint accepted malformed `manifest`
values (including a string), `publish`, and unknown top-level fields, but silently ignored them.
Permissive input handling is not manifest support.

Observed HTTP `201` create response fields:

| Field | Observed type/shape | Notes |
|-------|---------------------|-------|
| `app_id` | string | Identifier required for later management and cleanup |
| `app_name` | string | Echoes the requested name |
| `app_type` | `"s2s_oauth"` | Native create response type |
| `create_at` | date-time string | Live field is `create_at`, not documented `created_at` |
| `dev_public_key` | `{ "enabled": boolean }` | Public-key feature state; no key material was returned in the probe |
| `prod_public_key` | `{ "enabled": boolean }` | Production public-key feature state |
| `development_credentials` | `{ "client_id": string, "client_secret": string }` | The single S2S credential pair; the field name does not imply a second production state |
| `production_credentials` | absent by design | S2S has one credential state; do not treat this as an incomplete create response |
| `scopes` | string array | Echoes retained valid scopes; this is not sufficient proof that a newly minted token has propagated them |

The response does not echo `active`, `manifest`, `publish`, `company_name`, or contact fields.

Observed validation and routing behavior:

| Request case | HTTP/result | Implementation consequence |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| `active: false`, scopes omitted | `201`, `scopes: []` | Valid inactive draft |
| `active: true`, valid scope | `201`, requested scope returned | Valid active app |
| `active: true`, empty scopes | `404`, code `1500`, `invalid_scope_value` | Require at least one valid scope |
| `active: false`, invalid scope | `201`, invalid scope silently removed | Compare returned scopes with requested scopes |
| Malformed or wrong-type `manifest` | `201`, field ignored | Never infer S2S manifest support from create success |
| `publish` or unknown top-level fields | `201`, fields ignored | Send only S2S-native fields |
| Missing `contact_email` | `404`, code `1500`, missing required fields | Validate required fields client-side |
| S2S sent to `POST /v2/marketplace/apps` | `404`, code `1500` directing account route | Use `/v2/accounts/{accountId}/marketplace/apps` |
| Delete through `DELETE /v2/marketplace/apps/{appId}` | `200`, empty body | Accept `200` even though the schema documents `204`; verify removal with `GET /v2/marketplace/apps?type=account_created` |

Token exchange after active S2S creation:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://zoom.us/oauth/token?grant_type=account_credentials&account_id=$ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID" \
  -u "$ZOOM_CLIENT_ID:$ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET"
```

Observed HTTP `200` token response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "<redacted>",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3599,
  "scope": "space-delimited granted scopes",
  "api_url": "https://api-us.zoom.us"
}
```

The `scope` field can be absent or incomplete immediately after creation while the app/scopes
propagate. A follow-up token exchange after 12 seconds contained the requested scopes. Use a
bounded retry, verify the token response `scope`, and send API calls to the returned `api_url`
instead of assuming the global API hostname.

S2S manifest capability was tested with an active S2S token containing
`marketplace:read:app:admin` and `marketplace:write:app:admin`:

| Operation | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| `GET /v2/marketplace/apps/{appId}` | `200`; reported `app_type: "OAuthApp"`, `app_status: "unpublished"`, and the S2S scopes |
| `GET /v2/marketplace/apps/{appId}/manifest` | `404`, code `1500`: `You can only export Draft General app's manifest now` |
| `PUT /v2/marketplace/apps/{appId}/manifest` | `400`, `error: "invalid_manifest"`: `You can only update Draft General app now` |

Therefore, do not use the generic `app_type: "OAuthApp"` returned by the information endpoint
as proof that an S2S app is a General App. S2S configuration is managed through native fields
and scopes; General App manifest export/update does not apply.

### Delete Verification

Treat the delete response as an acknowledgement, not the final cleanup assertion. After
`DELETE /v2/marketplace/apps/{appId}` returns `200`, query:

```text
GET /v2/marketplace/apps?type=account_created&page_size=30
```

Confirm the deleted `app_id` is absent. A July 14, 2026 cleanup verified that two leftover S2S
probe apps disappeared only after this account-created listing check. Do not delete by app name
alone; use the exact `app_id` returned by the listing or create response.
